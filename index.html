                        All types of investments involve some level of risk, so it’s crucial to understand how
                        your money might be impacted. Risks differ between investments, meaning the chances of
                        profit or loss vary depending on the type of investment you choose.

                                At its core, investing is when you buy something with the expectation that it will grow
                                in
                                value over time. However, investments come with no guarantees, and you could receive
                                back
                                less than you initially invested.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When you start investing, you don’t need to commit a large amount of money right away.
                                It’s important to only invest an amount you’re comfortable with.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are several options for investing, including stocks, shares, and funds.

                                an option to consider.

                            <p>
                                You can also save for the future in cash accounts, which offer interest that can provide
                                additional income and access to your money if needed. The downside to cash savings is
                                that

                                    pay interest.

                                    Investing for growth aims to increase the value of your investments, also known as
                                    capital appreciation. For example, if you invest in stocks, growth occurs when the
                                    stock price increases.
                                </p>

                                    investment and the reinvested income will benefit from any additional growth.

                                investor might reinvest the income they receive, while a growth-focused investor might

                                        Historically, shares have offered better long-term returns than cash

                                    A fund is a type of collective investment, meaning your money is pooled with that of

                                        The benefit of ETFs is cost effectiveness. They offer lower fees due to lower
                                        operating costs.

                                    An investment trust is a company that raises money through selling shares to
                                    investors and then pool the money to purchase and sell a range of investments.
                                    Investment trusts can vary with different aims and mixes of shares and assets
                                </p>

                                        <span>Pros: Potential returns</span>
                                        Investment trusts have extra features such as being able to borrow money that
                                        may increase potential gains but also increase risk.
                                    </li>

                                        <span>Cons: Potential Price Volatility</span>
                                        The price of an investment trust can be influenced by the demand for the share.
                                        In a scenario where investors don’t feel the investment trusts is being managed
                                        as well as expected then this can impact the price when investors want to sell
                                        rather than buy.

                                    Bonds and gilts are a way for companies or governments to raise money which is done
                                    by borrowing money from investors. When you invest in a bond or gilt you’re lending
                                    money to a company or government which in return provides a fixed rate of interest.

                                        <span>Pros: Stability</span>
                                        Bonds and gilts have lower risks than stocks and have the potential to provide a
                                        more stable return over time.

                                        <span>Cons: Growth Potential</span>
                                        The drawback of bonds and gilts is that they don’t provide higher long term
                                        returns compared to other stocks. Bonds and gilts can be impacted negatively by
                                        changes to interest rates, economic uncertainty and currency fluctuations.
